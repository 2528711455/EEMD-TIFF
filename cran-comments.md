This version contains the following updates: (i) data downloaded from the Protected Planet website are saved to a temporary directory by default, (ii) improved compatibility with package dependencies (e.g. sf R package), and (iii) fixed compatibility issues with updates made to the Protected Planet website.

Cheers,
